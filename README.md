# ION playground
Testing ION, the DTN implementation of NASA

## Space communication issues
* Extreme distances => High rates of data loss + High RTT (Round-trip time)
* Orbital movements, discontinuity => Done manually by now

## Why not use the Internet
* Connections can be interrupted
* High delays because of distances
* Bit error rate can be very high

TODO: Continue explainations

## Start using ION

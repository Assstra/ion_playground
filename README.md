# ION Playground
Exploring ION, NASA's DTN (Delay-Tolerant Networking) implementation.

## Challenges in Space Communication
- **Extreme Distances**: Result in high data loss rates and significant RTT (Round-Trip Time).
- **Orbital Movements and Discontinuity**: Currently managed manually, leading to inefficiencies.

## Why Not Use the Internet?
- **Interrupted Connections**: Frequent disruptions make traditional protocols unsuitable.
- **High Delays**: Long distances introduce significant latency.
- **High Bit Error Rate**: Space environments lead to elevated error rates in data transmission.

*TODO: Expand explanations on these challenges.*

## Getting Started with ION

To begin using ION:
1. Follow the installation guide available on the [official ION repository](https://github.com/nasa/ion).
2. Choose a configuration to test. Quick start guides are provided in each configuration folder for easy setup.
